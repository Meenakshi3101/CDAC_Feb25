mysql> SELECT * FROM ORDERS
    -> WHERE CNUM =
    -> (SELECT CNUM FROM CUSTOMERS
    ->  WHERE CNAME  = 'Cisneros');
+------+---------+------------+------+------+
| Onum | Amt     | Odate      | Cnum | Snum |
+------+---------+------------+------+------+
| 3001 |   18.69 | 1990-10-03 | 2008 | 1007 |
| 3006 | 1098.16 | 1990-10-03 | 2008 | 1007 |
+------+---------+------------+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)



2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have 
above-average orders. 

mysql> SELECT Cname, Rating
    -> FROM customers
    -> WHERE Cnum IN (
    ->     SELECT Cnum
    ->     FROM orders
    ->     GROUP BY Cnum
    ->     HAVING SUM(Amt) > (SELECT AVG(Amt) FROM orders)
    -> );
+---------+--------+
| Cname   | Rating |
+---------+--------+
| Liu     |    200 |

3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for 
whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.

mysql> SELECT Snum, SUM(Amt) AS Total_Amount
    -> FROM orders
    -> GROUP BY Snum
    -> HAVING SUM(Amt) > (SELECT MAX(Amt) FROM orders);
+------+--------------+
| Snum | Total_Amount |
+------+--------------+
| 1001 |     15382.07 |
+------+--------------+
